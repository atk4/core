Agile Core was created for [Agile Data](https://github.com/atk4/data) and [Agile UI](https://github.com/atk4/ui), but can be used in any other framework too. You will mostly find PHP Traits here, that add functionality into your objects such as:

- Containers: Implements Parent/Child relations between your objects
- Hooks: Create hooks and register callbacks with priorities and arguments
- Initializers: Automatically execute init() method of your object
- Dynamic Methods: Add methods dynamically into existing objects
- Factory: Specify class name as a string
- App Scope: Inject global "app" object and pass it to new objects

Additionally you a much better 'Exception' class for general-purpose exceptions.
